in this page i would like to create a Portfolio by display photographs I have taken. It will have 3 sublink with Nature landscape, architecture, and dogs.
The first section will be nature photos. I Like to takes these photos when I go hiking or mostly just hanging-out in NYC parks. Mostly of close up of flowers
and threes. The flowing page will be of NYC architecture. Living in New York my whole life it really makes you appreciate the architecture around you.
The last link will be portrait photos I have taken of dogs this past year.
